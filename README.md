This directory contains the WordErrorRate module, test code, sample data, 
and licence information. To see how it works, just execute the test file
and examine the results:

./wer-test.pl

You may need to make the file executable:

chmod +x wer-test.pl

Or you may need to update the path to your perl by modifying the 
first line of wer-test.pl. I used /usr/bin/perl
